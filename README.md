# To Do Planner

#### Main moto
- Two types of planner we are going to implement here.
- One is regular to-do planner
- The other is daily to-do planner which is basically to-do things everyday. 
    - We can checkout the to-do items inside the planner in a day but the next day it refreshes to new planner.
    - Items will be refreshed everyday unless and until you remove the items manually.


### Features
- Splash screen
- View password while typing.
- Login as it requires to monitor the items based on the user.
- Page to enter the items for the planner initially. From next time we can use api store the items.
- Connect to Flask application which stores item planners in the database.
- Once development is done we can deploy to cloud.
