To Do Tasks
===========


### Introduction
To do tasks is normal to do lists with extra feature of tasks getting refreshed everyday i.e even after you tick off a task it gets unticked next day. The main advantage is it helps you keep track of the daily mandatory tasks and keep you aware of what is completed each day. This comes under daily tasks section. There is one more section called general tasks section which is similar to normal to do checklist.
